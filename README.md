Custom / Modified graphics for CUO / TazUO Ultima Online Client

Hey all.

I will modify this in the future but for now.

Explanation of the 3 folders:

Custom: This is just files for "Custom Gumps" using TazUO's Custom Gump feature

Original: This is just art that replaces existing art within the UO files

These folders are structured the same way your TazUO installation would be already. To install simply drop the files into your root TazUO folder. Folders affected are TUO/Data/XmlGumps and TUO/ExternalImages where TUO is your TazUO installation directory.
