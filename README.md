Hello Everyone. Thanks for stopping by to check out my stuff.

*Fiddle me This* is a collection of custom art and custom gumps for Ultima Online created by myself for personal use, but also to share with the community. The name Fiddle Me This is just a play on "Riddle Me This" from Batman - but with the tie in being that there is a program called UO Fiddler that allows you to look at, edit and extract art assets from .mul files that Ultima ONline uses.

My work is intended to be used with TUO(TazUO) which is a fork/modified version of CUO(ClassicUO). This version of the client has a PNG Overrides folder, allowing you to simply drop images into a folder and they will load into the game. This is much easier and cleaner than editing or patching .mul files. My files *can* be used with those patchers and such, if you know how to do so, and I may support this later - but for now they are meant to simply be downloaded and extracted into the TUO main directory (which will drop files into the externalimages (the override folder) and also Data/XmlGumps (for custom gumps).

**You'll notice two folders as discussed below:**

**Custom:** This folder contains art and XML files used for "Custom Gumps" such as custom Status Bars or HP/MP bars, etc.

**Original:** This folder contains only art that is used to override "original" art for gumps within UO

The *Excel File* titled "Art ID List" is a list of all the art IDs I have used (and others that will be used in the future). This list can help you find a particular art in case you want to edit it yourself or need to find it within an XML file. This currently only includes art IDs for my custom gump art. I will be updating this list later to include helping descriptions of all the other art in my pack, so you can easily know what they are for.

# Instructions
These folders are structured the same way your TazUO installation would be already. To install simply drop the files into your root TazUO folder. Folders affected are TUO/Data/XmlGumps and TUO/ExternalImages where TUO is your TazUO installation directory.
